Machine Learning for Molecular and Materials Science







Foundations



1. Quantum mechanics and Schrödinger equation: provide the fundamental laws that determine electron behaviour and bonding in materials.

2\. Structure → property relationships: explain how atomic arrangement controls physical and chemical properties.

3\. Computational chemistry and DFT: use approximate quantum methods to predict material properties before experiments.

4\. High-throughput simulations and databases: rapidly compute and store properties of thousands of materials for large-scale screening.
