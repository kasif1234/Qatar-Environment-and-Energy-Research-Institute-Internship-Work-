Compared to inorganic counterparts, organic TE devices emerged\nas the potential candidates for room-temperature and flexible (even wearable) TE\npower generation. During last few decades, extensive studies have been performed\non the p- and n-type materials and devices to build up the inter-relationship among\nthe TE parameters (i.e., electrical conductivity, Seebeck coefficient, thermal conductivity\nand power factors), demonstrating a great potential of organic TEs. In this review,\nrecent progresses in the organic TE materials and devices, dopants and doping method,\ncharge transport models and flexible TE device applications are summarized and the\nkey strategies and future prospects to further optimize TE performance are discussed.\nKeywords: organic thermoelectrics, waste heat, Seebeck coefficient, conductivity, power factor.\n1. Introduction\nThe use of renewable energy sources is becoming imperative\nowing to global warming and the shortage of fossil fuel reserves.1\nHeat is an abundant source of energy, but is often wasted irre-\nspective of whether it originates from natural sources like solar\nand geothermal sources or artificial sources like motor vehi-\ncles and the industrial sector.2 If heat from one of these sources\nis brought into contact with certain conductors or semiconductors,\nan electric current can be generated as a result of the potential\ndifference, which develops because of temperature gradient.\nThis phenomenon was discovered by Thomas J. Seebeck in 1821\nand is termed the Seebeck effect.3 The conversion of electrical\nenergy to thermal energy is known as the Peltier effect, which\nwas discovered by Jean Peltier (1834),4 and can be employed\nfor spot cooling or heating applications. Therefore, thermoelectric\n(TE) devices are attractive candidates for solving the energy\nproblem by means of harvesting waste heat and solar thermal\nenergy and are also useful for health monitoring sensors that\nemploy body heat. The performance of TE materials is generally\nexpressed by a dimensionless thermoelectric figure of merit\nZT,5-7\n(1)\nwhere α is the Seebeck coefficient, σ is electrical conductivity, κ\nis thermal conductivity, and T is the temperature. The power\nfactor (PF), expressed as PF = α2σ, is often used to compare the\nenergy conversion capabilities among different materials in\norganic TEs. However, the possibility of improving the PF is lim-\nited owing to the interdependence and coupling between the\ntwo major parameters, the α and σ. As α and σ are strongly and\noppositely dependent on the carrier concentration associated\nwith the electronic structure of the materials, these two param-\neters need to be fine-modulated to optimize the resulting PF. \nSo far, inorganic materials like bismuth telluride (Bi2Te3), tin\nselenide (SnSe), lead telluride (PbTe), and silicon-germanium\n(SiGe) have been investigated for their TE properties.8-11 These\nmaterials have been employed in TE devices with a high figure\nof merit (ZT>2),12 and successfully commercialized. Despite their\nhigh performance, these materials have several disadvantages\nsuch as their high cost, toxicity, high thermal conductivity much\nlarger than 1W m-1 K-1,13 and processing difficulties. Conversely,\norganic materials offer more cost-effective high-throughput\nfabrication using solution-based printing techniques with the\nadditional advantages such as facile tunability of molecular struc-\ntures to tailor the properties, low temperature energy harvest-\ning and temperature sensing, etc. Organic materials are flexible\nand robust with low weight and low thermal conductivity (0.1-\n0.8W m-1 K-1).14 Therefore, organic TE materials have been identi-\nfied as an alternative to find complementary applications of inor-\nganic TE materials and considerable efforts have been devoted\nSoonyong Lee†,1\nSoohyun Kim†,2\nAmbika Pathak1\nAyushi Tripathi1\nTian Qiao2\nYeran Lee1\nHyunjung Lee*,2\nHan Young Woo*,1\n1Department of Chemistry, College of Science, Korea University, 145 Anam-ro, Seongbuk-gu, Seoul \n02841, Korea\n2School of Advanced Materials Engineering, Kookmin Univ., Jeongneung-ro 77, Seongbuk-gu, Seoul \n02707, Korea\nReceived March 20, 2020 / Revised April 23, 2020 / Accepted April 28, 2020\nZT\nα2σT\nk\n------------\n=\nAcknowledgments: This work was supported by the National Research\nFoundation (NRF) of Korea (Grants NRF-2019R1A2C2085290, 2019-\nR1A6A1A11044070, 2017R1A2B2010552, and 2015R1A5A7037615). \n*Corresponding Authors: Hyunjung Lee (hyunjung@kookmin.ac.kr), \nHan Young Woo (hywoo@korea.ac.kr)\n†S.

Despite all the aforementioned\nadvantages, the development of efficient organic TE materials\nis hampered by the low carrier mobility and mediocre α. How-\never, ongoing efforts involving the development of doping strate-\ngies and structural design have proved helpful to attain high ZT\nvalues of 1.02 and 0.2 for p- and n-type TE materials, respec-\ntively.15-17 Organic TE materials and devices have great potential\nas a sustainable power source, i.e., room temperature (or low\ntemperature) TE energy harvesting for flexible (or wearable)\nelectronic devices. Considerable effort has been made to adopt\ndifferent doping strategies and to design potential building blocks\nfor organic TE materials. In this review, we discuss recent out-\ncomes in the field of p- and n-type organic thermoelectric mate-\nrials, developments of dopants and doping methods, modelling\nof charge transport in organic TE materials and flexible TE device\n(or module) applications, and highlight the approaches that have\nbeen proposed and employed to increase the α, σ, and PF.\n2. Organic Thermoelectric Materials\n2.1. p-Type Thermoelectric Materials\nAn extensively studied p-type TE material is poly(3,4-ethylene-\ndioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS). Its facile\nprocessability and stability when heavily doped have resulted\nin the positively doped PEDOT with PSS counterions being con-\nsidered as the most promising conducting polymer for TE applica-\ntions. In-depth research has been conducted to enhance its TE\nperformance, mainly by optimizing dopants and doping meth-\nodologies in an attempt to maximize the PF. Excess PSS, which\nacts as an insulator in PEDOT:PSS films, limits charge carrier\ntransport, resulting in the σ of 0.012-17 S cm-1 and PF of 0.0016-\n0.9 μW m-1 K-2.18 Various studies have attempted to optimize\nthe electrical properties of PEDOT:PSS, for example, introduction\nof a polar solvent such as dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) facilitates\nphase segregation by weakening the Coulombic attraction between\nthe positively charged PEDOT and negatively charged PSS via a\nscreening effect, thus obtaining high σ. Furthermore, post-treat-\nments have been reported to modulate the phase segregation\nof PEDOT:PSS and structural change of the PEDOT chains to that\nof a quinoid structure. \nCrispin et al. tried to control the oxidation level of PEDOT:PSS\nby fabricating electrochemical transistors. By applying high\ngate voltage to the PEDOT:PSS film, they succeeded in increas-\ning α whereas σ decreased with reduced carrier concentration.\nThey obtained a maximum PF of 23.5 μW m-1 K-2 with σ in the\nrange of 0.3-300 S cm-1 and α in the range of 20-400 μV K-1 when\nthe doping level was lowered from 33% to 14.5%.19 In 2013,\nLuo et al. reported the effects of post-treatment, which included\nthe addition of DMSO to a PEDOT:PSS solution, followed by spin\ncasting and post-treatment of the thin PEDOT:PSS film with a\nmixture of DMSO and the ionic liquid (IL), 1-ethyl-3-methylim-\nidazolium tetrafluoroborate (EMIM-BF4). Primarily, the addition\nof DMSO to PEDOT:PSS resulted in an interconnected network\nwith elongated PEDOT grains, resulting in a maximum PF of\n30.1 μW m-1 K-2 with σ = 930.41 S cm-1 and α = 17.99 μV K-1. In\naddition, post-treatment with EMIMBF4 induced an intercon-\nnected network of short and circular PEDOT grains with increased\npolaron density, resulting in further improvement in α to max-\nimize the PF (38.46 μW m-1 K-2).20 Likewise, Pipe et al. reported\nthe mixing of PEDOT:PSS with ethylene glycol (EG)/DMSO fol-\nlowed by immersion in an EG solution. This method successfully\nthinned out the PSS layer, which enhanced the charge carrier\nmobility ascribed to the reduced tunneling distance between\nthe conductive domains. Their approach increased both σ and\nα, and suppressed the thermal conductivity from 0.30 to 0.22\nW m-1 K-1 in the DMSO-mixed PEDOT:PSS and from 0.32 to 0.23\nW m-1 K-1 in EG-mixed PEDOT:PSS.21 Similarly, Kim et al. reported\na post-treatment method that entails applying a coating con-\nsisting of a mixture of DMSO and hydrazine (as a reducing agent)\nto a PEDOT:PSS film, reducing the bipolarons into polarons or\nneutral states in the PEDOT chains, with the benefit of enhanc-\ning the α values. By controlling the concentration of hydrazine\n(0.0175 wt%), the film exhibited the maximum PF of 112 μW\nm-1 K-2 with σ of 578 S cm-1 and α of 67 μV K-1.22 Furthermore,\nGong et al. reported a post-treatment method using DMSO and\npoly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) which led to both σ and α increasing\nsimultaneously. The addition of PEO, which strongly interacts\nwith PEDOT, increased the bipolarons in the PEDOT backbone.\nThe formation of increased bipolaron states, which was con-\nfirmed by Raman and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, enhanced\nthe delocalization of charge carriers on the conjugated backbone\nand thus increased the σ. In addition, the distribution of the log-\narithm of density of states (DOS) is highly asymmetric at the Fermi\nlevel (EF) for PEDOT in the bipolaron states. Here α is proportional\nto the derivative of DOS at EF and the increased α values were\nobtained from the doped PEDOT:PSS ﬁlms with enhanced ratios\nof PEDOT in the bipolaron state. They thus measured σ of 1061\nS cm-1 and α of 38.4μV K-1 at the maximum PF of 157.4 μW m-1 K-2,\nwhen PEDOT:PSS was doped with 5% DMSO and 0.3% PEO.23\nOuyang et al. reported the sequential treatment of the PEDOT:PSS\nfilm with acid (H2SO4) and base (NaOH) to increase both the α\nand σ values. The treatment with acid facilitated the charge trans-\nport with enhanced σ and treatment with the base dedoped the\nPEDOT and localized the positive charges, lowering the charge\nconcentration with enhanced α. The maximum PF of 334 μW m-1\nK-2 with σ of 2170 S cm-1 and α of 39.2 μV K-1, were obtained by\ncarefully adjusting the treatment with acid and base at room\ntemperature.24 In 2018, Ouyang and coworkers also reported\npost-treatments using a series of ILs, 1-ethyl-3-methylimidaz-\nolium dicyanamide (EMIM-DCA), 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium\nbis(triﬂuoromethylsulfonyl)imide (EMIM-TFSI) and EMIM-BF4\non the PEDOT:PSS surface. The accumulation of cations on the\ncold side while enhancing the mean hole energy, led to an increase\nin α. Using EMIM-DCA, they achieved the maximum PF of 754\nμW m-1 K-2 and ZT of 0.75. The TE performance is also compet-\nitive against highly functioning inorganic TE materials such as\nbismuth telluride.16\nIn addition to various post treatments of PEDOT:PSS films,\ndifferent counterions to replace PSS, such as perchlorate (ClO4\n-),\nhexafluorophosphate (PF6\n-), bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide\n(TFSI-),25 and tosylate (Tos), have been also introduced to optimize\nthe thermoelectric properties.

TDAE formed a salt with the Tos anions by supplying\nelectrons to oxidized PEDOTs. The salt was further removed by\nrinsing the films with water. Thereby, the oxidation level was\nvaried between 9 and 36%. At the optimal oxidation level of\n22%, a maximum PF of 324 µW m-1 K-2 was achieved, resulting\nin a ZT of 0.25 at room temperature.26 Kim et al. introduced PP-\nPEDOT:Tos (PP-PEDOT: prepared from a mixture of pyridine\nand triblock copolymer, poly(ethylene glycol)-block-poly(pro-\npylene glycol)-block-poly(ethylene glycol), (PEG-PPG-PEG)) to\nuse as electrodes where the oxidation level of the deposited poly-\nmer could be adjusted by applying an electrical potential. The\noptimized films exhibited σ of 117 S cm-1 and α of 930 µV K-1,\nleading to an unprecedented maximum PF of 1270 µW m-1 K-2\nwith a high ZT value of 1.02.17 Furthermore, Crispin et al. demon-\nstrated a PEDOT transition from the Fermi glass (PEDOT:PSS) to\na semi-metal with the Tos counterion (PEDOT:Tos). After treat-\ning the film with PEG-PPG-PEG, the grazing-incidence wide-angle\nX-ray scattering (GIWAXS) study showed that the PEDOT:Tos\nexhibited a well-ordered crystalline pattern compared to\nPEDOT:PSS. The introduction of Tos ions enabled them to maxi-\nmize α and σ at 55 µV K-1 and 1500 S cm-1 at room temperature,\nrespectively.27\nOverall, PEDOT derivatives have been extensively studied as\nthe most promising p-type TE material; however, their shortcom-\nings, such as the hygroscopic and acidic properties and the insu-\nlating counterions of PSS motivated researchers to broaden their\nscope to develop new p-type TE polymers. Primarily, researchers\ninvestigated the thermoelectric properties of other p-type mol-\necules that were previously shown to exhibit superior charge\ntransport characteristics for organic thin-film transistors and solar\ncells. Several highly performing TE polymers have been designed\nbased on the poly(2,5-bis(3-alkylthiophen-2-yl)thieno[3,2-b]thio-\nphene) (PBTTT) structure, with a highly ordered morphology\nin film owing to its liquid crystalline nature.28 Earlier papers reported\nthat PBTTT-C14 (with tetradecyl side-chains), obtained by immer-\nsion doping using a nitrosonium hexafluorophosphate (NOPF6)\ndopant, yielded a maximum PF of 1 μW m-1 K-2, and PBTTT-C12\n(with dodecyl side-chains), obtained by immersion doping with\nFe(III) bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (Fe(TFSI)3), yielded a\nmaximum PF of 14 μW m-1 K-2.29 Chabinyc et al. studied the effect\nof the different dopants 4-ethyl-benzenesulfonic acid (EBSA) and\n(tridecafluoro-1,1,2,2-tetrahydrooctyl)-trichlorosilane (FTS) on\nPBTTT-C14 films. Even though the value of σ that was achieved\nby using EBSA (1300 S cm-1) via solution doping was higher than\nthat of FTS (1000 S cm-1) via vapor doping, the vapor-doped\nPBTTT-C14:FTS film had a maximum PF of 110 μW m-1 K-2. They\nobserved that the strongly amorphous character resulting from\nFTS doping had little effect on the conductivity while greatly\nincreasing the value of α. Moreover, they postulated that the\ndisordered region may have led to strongly perturbed DOS, thus,\nenhancing α.30 Later, Chabinyc and coworkers investigated the\nTE characteristics of PBTTT-C14 by doping with 2,3,5,6-tetraflu-\noro-7,7,8,8-tetracyanoquinodimethane (F4TCNQ) and 2,5-diflu-\noro-7,7,8,8-tetracyanoquinodimethane (F2TCNQ) in the vapor\nand solution states. In the vapor-doped polymer films with F4TCNQ,\nan elongated orientation correlation length (OCL) was observed\nusing resonance soft X-ray scattering (RSoXS). Increased OCL\ncan be correlated with charge carrier mobility (μ) and the\nimprovement of σ without significantly affecting α. Therefore,\nthe vapor-doped PBTTT-C14 with F4TCNQ exhibited the maxi-\nmum PF of 120 μW m-1 K-2 with of 670 S cm-1 and of 42 μV K-1\nwhereas doping with F2TCNQ yielded maximum PF of 70 μW\nm-1 K-2.31\nAnother widely studied p-type polymer is poly(3-hexylthio-\nphene) (P3HT). Its regio-regular arrangement of side-chains\nallows efficient π-π stacking of the conjugated backbones with\npronounced charge carrier transport properties. For example,\nZhu et al. reported that P3HT film doped with Fe(III) (TFSI)3\nachieved a maximum PF of 26 μW m-1 K-2 at temperatures between\n300 and 340 K, which was attributed to its high carrier concen-\ntration (1.62 × 1021 cm-3).32 In addition, to improve the PF by utiliz-\ning different doping methods, Jang et al. prepared P3HT:FeCl3\nfilms by wire bar coating. This method improved the intermo-\nlecular chain packing, yielding high σ (254 S cm-1) and a maxi-\nmum PF of 35 μW m-1 K-2.33 In 2017, Cho et al. compared the TE\nproperties of P3HT and a diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP)-based\npolymer (PDPP3T) by drop-cast sequential doping with FeCl3.\nThe maximum PF values were determined to be 56 μW m-1 K-2\nfor P3HT and 276 μW m-1 K-2 for PDPP3T, respectively. Electron\ndelocalization in the backbone, enhanced intramolecular charge-\ntransport, and large polarizability induced by the donor-accep-\ntor (D-A) structure of the PDPP3T resulted in the conformation\nbeing preserved after doping, which influenced the hopping and\ncarrier transport process between the conjugated polymer\nchains.34\nLeclerc et al. reported a series of carbazole-based D-A poly-\nmers, poly[N-9’-heptadecanyl-2,7-carbazole-alt-5,5’-(4’,7’-\ndi-2-thienyl-2’,1',3’-benzothiadiazole] (PCDTBT), poly[N-9’-hep-\ntadecanyl-2,7-carbazole-alt-5,5-(2,2’-bithiophene)] (PCDT), and\npoly[N-9’-heptadecanyl-2,7-carbazole-alt-5,5’-(2,2’-(1,4-phenyl-\nene)dithiophene)] (PCDTB). Addition of planar moieties such\nas benzene and benzothiadiazole (BT) units to PCDTB and PCDTBT\nwere shown to increase the crystalline morphology by increas-\ning the interchain interaction, thus facilitating charge carrier\ntransport. After doping with FeCl3, PCDTBT showed the maxi-\nmum σ of 500 S cm-1 and PF of 19 μW m-1 K-2, which is higher\nthan those of PCDT (PF = 6.5 μW m-1 K-2) and PCDTB (PF = 14\nμW m-1 K-2).35\nSystematic variation of the heteroaromatic moieties incor-\nporated in the conjugated polymeric main chain has been proven\nto be effective to tune the electronic structure and intermolecu-\nlar packing interactions. Yee et al. reported a series of FeCl3-doped\npoly(3-alkylchalcogenophene) (P3RT) derivatives, P3RS, P3RSe,\nand P3RTe (where R is 3,7-dimethyloctyl). The optical band gaps\ndecreased as the heteroatom of the chalcogen changed from S\nthrough Se to Te. They additionally observed an increase in σ as\nthe heteroatom changed from P3RS (4 S cm-1) to P3RSe (29 S\ncm-1) to P3RTe (46 S cm-1) at [FeCl3] = 1 × 10-3 M. However, at a\nhigher concentration of [FeCl3] = 5 × 10-3 M, the P3RS and P3RSe\npolymers exhibited higher σ (17 and 52 S cm-1) compared to\nP3RTe (σ = 14 S cm-1). As a result, at [FeCl3] = 5 × 10-3 M, P3RT and\nP3RSe achieved higher maximum PF of 12 and 13 µW m-1 K-2,\ncompared to P3RTe.36 Similarly, Zhu et al. reported a Se-substi-",

As a\nresult, PDPPSe-12 exhibited maximum σ of 997 S cm-1 at [FeCl3]\n= 16 mM whereas that of PDPPS-12 was 318 S cm-1 at [FeCl3] = 14\nmM. The maximum PF of 300 μW m-1K-2 was achieved for PDPPSe-\n12 at room temperature, which was twice as high as that of PDPPS-\n12 (126 μW m-1 K-2). Moreover, PDPPSe-12 yielded the maximum\nPF of 364 μW m-1 K-2 at 55 °C, which is attributed to the combination\nof thermally activated hopping and dopant-induced ion scattering.37\nDiversification of the structural modifications and doping\nmethodology has enabled the successful optimization of the\nthermoelectric parameters, particularly in terms of the σ. How-\never, further investigations are required to tune the α. System-\natic approaches have been performed to resolve the trade-off\nbetween the α and σ. For example, Azoulay et al. synthesized a\nproquinoidal thiadiazoloquinoxaline (TQ)-based polymer, poly(4-\n(4,4-dihexadecyl-4H-cyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophen-2-yl)-\n6,7-dimethyl[1,2,5]-thiadiazolo[3,4-g]quinoxaline) (PCQ). The\nopen-shell electronic ground state of this compound yielded a\nσ of ∼10-3 S cm-1 and large α (> 1000 μV K-1) for the pristine film.\nThe use of an open-shell dopant, the galvinoxyl radical (Gav),\nincreased σ by ~100-fold while minimally impacting the value\nof α (it decreased by a factor of ~2), yielding the optimal PF of\n> 10 μW m-1 K-2.38 Similarly, Xu et al. synthesized a series of 2,6-\ndialkyl-benzo[1,2-d;4,5-d']bistriazole (BBTa26)-based proquinoidal\nconjugated polymers pBBTa26-2T (containing dithiophene),\npBBTa26-4T (tetrathiophene), pBBTa26-TT (thieno[3,2-b]thio-\nphene), and pBBT26a-BDT (benzodithiophene). Because of the\nproquinoid character of all four polymers, they showed high σ\nvalues of 10-5 to 10-2 S cm-1 in the neat film without doping. Spe-\ncifically, pBBTa26-TT exhibited an exceptionally high σ of 10-2 S\ncm-1 owing to the small dihedral angle (0.1-0.2°) of its backbone.\nDespite the amorphous and face-on oriented morphology, a\nmaximum σ of 102.1 S cm-1 was obtained for pBBTa26-TT by\nsequential doping with a solution of F4TCNQ. The highly intra-\nchain-delocalized polarons were responsible for the increase\nin σ. Even though α is inversely related to σ, the simultaneous\nenhancement of α and σ could be made to occur via carrier-\ninduced softening induced by delocalized polarons, and the\nresulting maximum PF of 6.8 μW m-1 K-2 was obtained for pBB-\nTa26-TT. Interestingly, the π-spacer 2T containing pBBTa26-\n2T with maximum σ of 43.1 S cm-1 showed remarkably high PF\nof 11.8 μW m-1 K-2.39 The conductivity can be increased by increas-\ning the charge carrier concentration. In addition, it would be\npossible to boost μ and σ by optimizing the morphology of the\ncrystalline film. Woo et al. reported a series of polypyrrole (PPy)\nfilms that were ionically interconnected via two-monomer-\nconnected-precursor polymerization by various diacid linkers.\nVariation of these linkers enabled the film morphology and electri-\ncal properties to be successfully modulated. The PPy-Nap polymer\nwith 1,5-naphthalenedisulfonic acid as a fused aromatic linker\nexhibited a higher σ (~78 S cm-1) than that (6.7 S cm-1) of the refer-\nence PPy without a linker (PPy-ref) and the resulting PF of PPy-Nap\nwas higher than that of PPy-ref (0.21 vs. 0.043 μW m-1 K-2). This\ncan be attributed to the μ of PPy-Nap being approximately five\ntimes higher owing to its tighter cofacial π-π stacking and crys-\ntalline morphology compared to PPy-ref. All PPys had similar\ncharge carrier concentrations with similar α (5-8 μV K-1). This\nstudy suggested that both σ and PF could be increased while\nmaintaining α by enhancing the ordered conductive domains\nand μ at the same doping level.40\nXu et al. also reported two high-spin proquinoid benzo[1,2-\nc;4,5-c']bisthiadiazole (BBT)-based polymers, pBBT-2T-TT and\npBBT-2T-2T, which contain TT and 2T as π-spacers, respectively.\nThe strong quinoid character of the BBT polymers allowed effi-\ncient intramolecular delocalization of the polarons/bipolarons\nand intermolecular long-range ordering. Extensive intra- and\nintermolecular delocalization of the polarons/bipolarons also\nled to a large increase in α via carrier-induced softening. The use\nof sequential solution doping using FeCl3 as p-dopant resulted\nin the maximum being determined to be 287 S cm-1 and 313.9 S\ncm-1 for pBBT-2T-TT and pBBT-2T-2T, respectively. Interest-\ningly, density functional theory and variable temperature elec-\ntron paramagnetic resonance (VT-EPR) spectroscopy were used\nto calculate that pBBT-2T-TT possesses triplet bipolarons. The\ntriplet bipolarons can induce the high α value via the spin entropy\ncontribution. The formation of triplet bipolarons in pBBT-2T-\nTT was rationalized on the basis of its larger α despite its high σ.\nBy controlling the level of doping, the maximum PF of 65.2 µW\nm-1 K-2 with σ of 232.7 S cm-1 and α of 49.4 µV K-1 of pBBT-2T-TT was\nhigher than the PF obtained for pBBT-2T-2T (PF = 43.5 µW m-1\nK-2).41 Jang et al. reported two different cyclopentadithiophene\n(CDT)-based polymers, PCDTFBT and PCDTPT, which contained\nfluorinated benzothiadiazole (FBT) and pyridinethiadiazole (PT),\nrespectively. They used D-A molecular design to tune the highest\noccupied molecular orbital (HOMO)-lowest unoccupied molec-\nular orbital (LUMO) levels over a wide range. The HOMO levels they\nobtained for both molecules were appropriate such that doping\nwith F4TCNQ induced efficient charge transfer. Moreover, the long\nside-chains of these molecules were responsible for retaining their\ngood solubilities even at high dopant contents (up to 38 mol%).\nThis permitted the preparation of uniform polymer:dopant films\nfor which maximum PF of 31.5 μW m-1 K-2 and 21.8 μW m-1 K-2 was\neventually obtained for PCDTFBT and PCDTPT, respectively.42\nAdditionally, side-chain engineering (i.e., the chain length, struc-\nture, and branch point in the solubilizing alkyl side-chains)\npresents an efficient way to adjust the intermolecular packing\nin the solid state as well as in solution, yielding different charge\ntransport and TE characteristics. For instance, PDPP(2-OD)2TT,\ncomprised of alternating DPP and TT moieties with 2-octyldodecyl\nsubstituents, was well characterized for organic thin film tran-\nsistor (OTFT) applications, showing a hole mobility (μh) of 1 to\n10 cm2 V-1 s-1. Kiriy et al. modified the side-chains by extending the\nbranching point (6-octyldodecyl) to synthesize PDPP(6-OD)2TT\nwith the aim of improving the solubility and crystallinity of the\nfilm and studied its TE performance by using the two different\ndopants F4TCNQ and hexacyanotrimethylenecyclopropane",

In this report, the maximum conductivity of the\nPDPP(6-DO)2TT:F4TCNQ ﬁlms was 10-2 S cm-1 whereas that of the\nPDPP(6-DO)2TT:CN6-CP films was superior (70 S cm-1). This\ndifference was attributed to more effective doping with CN6-CP\ncompared to F4TCNQ as the LUMO (-5.87 eV) level of CN6-CP is\npositioned below the HOMO level of PDPP(6-DO)2TT (-5.5 eV),\noffering a feasible charge transfer process.43 Muller et al. focused\non improving the processability of the polymer and reported\nthe p(g42T-TT) polymer, which consists of a rigid bithiophene–\nthienothiophene (2T-TT) backbone with tetraethylene glycol\nside-chains on the bithiophene moiety. This improved the com-\npatibility of the polymer and dopant, promoting coprocessing\nand morphologically stable polymer:dopant blends. The elec-\ntron-donating tetraethylene glycol side-chains of the p(g42T-T)\npolymer decreased the ionization energy, thus making it possible\nto use even weaker dopants, i.e., 3-dichloro-5,6-dicyano-1,4-benzo-\nquinone (DDQ). As a result, for both F4TCNQ and DDQ, a σ of\n100 S cm-1 was achieved, demonstrating that side-chain engi-\nneering has a critical influence on the film morphology, charge\ncarrier transport, and resulting TE properties.44 Woo et al. reported a\nnew D-A type conjugated polymer, poly[(4,4’-(bis(hexyldecyl-\nsulfanyl)methylene)cyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b’]-dithiophene)-alt-\n(benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole)] (PCPDTSBT), which is based on\nCDT-benzothiadiazole (BT) units and with the normal alkyl side-\nchains replaced with bis(alkylsulfanyl)methylene substituents.\nThe introduction of sp2-hybridized side-chains and sulfur-sulfur\n(S-S) chalcogen interactions successfully enhanced the chain pla-\nnarity and crystalline interchain packing. Moreover, when the\npolymer was doped with 9 mol% of B(C6F5)3, it exhibited the\nmaximum σ (7.47 S cm-1), which was about one order of mag-\nnitude higher than that of PCPDTBT (0.65 S cm-1) with normal\nethylhexyl side-chains.

This discovery focused the attention on NDI-based D-A\ntype TE materials and these structures became one of the most\nextensively studied n-type TE materials.49 Subsequent work by\nChabinyc et al. led them to report the material N2200 and its\nunusual TE properties in 2014.50 After doping with 9 mol% of\n1,3-dimethyl-2-phenyl-2,3-dihydro-1H-benzo[d]imidazoles (N-\nDMBI), the optimal α, σ, and PF values were determined to be\n-850 μV K-1, 8 × 10-3 S cm-1, and 0.6 μW m-1 K-2, respectively. Based\non morphological analyses using atomic force microscopy (AFM)\nand GIWAXS, they observed no significant morphological changes\nwhen compared to pristine films. Using the maximum carrier\nconcentration value, they estimated the doping efficiency of ~1%,\nindicating that the formation of aggregates on the surface was\ncaused by poor miscibility of the dopant and polymer. The low\ndoping efficiency was the main reason for low PF and the authors\nsuggested that the TE performance of N2200 could be further\nimproved by increasing the miscibility of dopants. \nTo improve the miscibility of dopants in polymer matrices\nand the resulting doping efficiency, Koster et al. introduced polar\ntriethylene glycol (TEG)-based side-chains instead of nonpolar\nalkyl chains and synthesized a new polymer TEG-N2200.51 Using\nN-DMBI as a dopant, the optimal s, a, and PF were determined\nto be 0.17 S cm-1, -153 μV K-1, and 0.40 μW m-1 K-2, respectively.\nThey measured the carrier density with admittance spectroscopy\nand determined the doping efficiency over 10%. The GIWAXS\ndata indicated that TEG-N2200 in neat film had a dominant edge-\non orientation in contrast to N2200 (face-on) probably because\nof different interactions between the polar side-chains and glass\nsubstrates. AFM analysis showed that the film morphology had\nimproved substantially, suggesting that the introduction of polar\nTEG chains improved the miscibility with polar dopants com-\npared to the doped N2200 film. Similarly, Muller et al. synthesized\na new TE polymer, p(gNDI-gT2) based on NDI-bithiophene units.52,53\nThey modified N2200 by incorporating polar oligoethylene glycol\n(OEG) side-chains on both NDI and the bithiophene moieties.\nThe EPR analysis revealed a doping efficiency of ~13% at 20 mol%\nN-DMBI, attributed to the good miscibility of p(gNDI-gT2) and\nN-DMBI. The increased doping efficiency resulted in a two-fold\nincrease in the conductivity compared to that of the N2200\npolymer. The optimal σ, α, and PF were 0.3 S cm-1, -190 V K-1, and\n0.4 μW m-1 K-2, respectively.\nKoster et al. synthesized two kinds of TEG-substituted NDI-\nbased n-type polymers, P(NDI2TEG-2T) and P(NDI2TEG-2Tz).\nThese two polymers differ in that the bithiophene unit in the for-\nmer was replaced by a bithiazole moiety in the latter. The DFT\ncalculation showed that P(NDI2TEG-2Tz) exhibited a more pla-\nnar structure compared to P(NDI2TEG-2T) owing to the sp2-N\natoms in the thiazole units. The calculation agreed with the GIWAXS\nanalysis which showed that P(NDI2TEG-2Tz) had the more\ndesirable edge-on orientation. After doping with N-DMBI, σ\nincreased from 4.8 × 10-11 to 7.0 × 10-4 S cm-1 for P(NDI2TEG-2T)\nand from 1.6 × 10-9 to 1.8 S cm-1 for P(NDI2TEG-2Tz). The max-\nimum PF values were measured to be 2.3 × 10-4 and 4.5 μW m-1\nK-2 for P(NDI2TEG-2T) and P(NDI2TEG-2Tz), respectively.54 The\nresult emphasized the importance of chain planarity for efficient\ncharge carrier transport and the resulting electrical/thermoelec-\ntric properties. Based on this motivation, Fabiano et al. synthesized a\nladder-type n-type polymer poly(benzimidazobenzophenan-\nthroline) (BBL) in 2016.55 The highly fused conjugated backbone\nwithout solubilizing side-chains provided a highly rigid and pla-\nnar polymer backbone with pronounced p-stacking. After doping\nwith the vapor dopant TDAE, the maximum σ of BBL increased\nfrom ~10-3 to 1.7 S cm-1 and the maximum PF was determined\nto be 0.43 μW m-1 K-2, emphasizing that the chain rigidity and\nplanarity of these ladder-type structures play an important role\nin improving the σ and PF. \nTakimiya et al. combined two electron-deficient building blocks,\nBBT and naphtho[2,3-b:6,7-b']-dithiophenediimide (NDTI), to\nsynthesize two new polymers P(NDTI-BBT-DP) and P(NDTI-\nBBT-DT) with different alkyl side-chains, i.e., 3-decylpentadecyl\n(DP) and 2-decyltetradecyl (DT).56 Both of these two polymers\nhave low-lying HOMO (-5.5 eV) and LUMO (-4.4 eV) levels. In OTFT\ndevices, the electron mobility μe of P(NDTI-BBT-DP) was 0.31 cm2\nV-1 s-1 and after doping with N-DMBI, σ of 5 S cm-1 and PF of 14.2\nμW m-1 K-2 were obtained. However, P(NDTI-BBT-DT) exhibited\nμe of 0.096 cm2 V-1 s-1 in OTFTs and the optimal values of σ and\nPF (0.18 S cm-1 and 0.6 μW m-1 K-2) were lower compared to those\nof P(NDTI-BBT-DP). GIWAXS data showed that the crystallinity\nof P(NDTI-BBT-DP) film was not affected by doping. They sug-\ngested the preserved morphology of P(NDTI-BBT-DP) to be the\nreason for the higher σ and PF compared to those of P(NDTI-BBT-\nDT), indicating that a slight modification of the alkyl side-chains\ncan significantly influence the electrical properties. \nIn 2017, Zhu et al. synthesized aromatic-dicyanovinyl-dipyr-\nrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4-diylidene-bis(thieno[3,2-b]thiophene)\n(A-DCV-DPPTT) and quinoid-dicyanomethylene-dipyrrolo[3,4-\nc]pyrrole-1,4-diylidene-bis(thieno[3,2-b]thiophene) (Q-DCM-\nDPPTT) to study the role of a conjugated backbone on the TE\nproperties.15 A-DCV-DPPTT has a conjugated aromatic backbone\nwhereas Q-DCM-DPPTT has a quinoid structure. A-DCV-DPPTT\ndemonstrated optimal σ, α, and PF of 0.31 S cm-1, -568 μV K-1,\nand 95 μW m-1 K-2 respectively, at room temperature. However,\nwhen the properties were measured at 373 K, the PF increased\nto 217 μW m-1 K-2, which is the highest PF for n-type TE molecules\namong those reported thus far. In contrast, Q-DCM-DPPTT exhib-\nited much lower σ, α, and PF of 0.11 S cm-1, -383 μV K-1, and 1.7\nμW m-1 K-2, respectively, and the PF measured at 373 K was 4.2\nμW m-1 K-2. After doping with N-DMBI, A-DCV-DPPTT films\nunderwent no obvious changes in their morphology even at a\ndopant concentration of approximately 10 wt%. In the case of\nthe Q-DCM-DPP films, the dopants started to aggregate on the\nfilm as the dopant concentration was increased (5 wt% N-DMBI).\nGIWAXS measurements of A-DCV-DPPTT revealed no significant\nchanges and displayed stronger edge-on scattering peaks com-\npared to Q-DCM-DPPTT. They suggested that the large difference\nin the TE properties was caused by the different degree of conju-\ngation of the backbone, which resulted in the morphology and\ndoping efficiency being different. \nRecently, Pei et al. reported a series of promising n-type TE\npolymers based on different conjugated backbones. For exam-\nple, in 2015, they synthesized an n-type polymer based on the\nbenzodifurandione-phenylenevinylene moiety (BDPPV), which\nhas a partially locked (two-thirds of the backbone) conformation",

They additionally\nsynthesized a fluorine-substituted polymer, FBDPPV, where the\nF-substitution not only lowered the LUMO, but also fully locked\nthe chain conformation via the formation of intramolecular hydro-\ngen bonds, thereby increasing μe up to 1.70 cm2 V-1 s-1 in ambient\natmosphere. The equivalent polymer with chlorine substituents,\nClBDPPV, was also prepared, enabling researchers to explore the\nTE properties and the effects of the halogen atoms on the TE\nproperties of BDPPV polymers.59 FBDPPV doped with N-DMBI\nshowed impressively high σ of 14 S cm-1 and PF of 28 μW m-1 K-2 ,\nwhen compared with the other two polymers (σ = 0.26 and 7 S\ncm-1; PF = 1.6 and 16.5 μW m-1 K-2 for BDPPV and ClBDPPV,\nrespectively). AFM analysis indicated that all three films had\nremarkably smooth surfaces (root mean square roughness ~0.60\nnm) at 5 wt% N-DMBI, and the morphology did not significantly\nchange even at 10 wt% dopant. This good miscibility of the dop-\nants in the case of all three of the films was suggested to be caused\nby the low crystallinity of the three films; in fact, GIWAXS anal-\nysis revealed low lamellar diffraction peaks. The low crystallinity\nof the BDPPV derivatives was also considered to allow improved\ndispersion of the dopants in the polymer films to increase the\ndoping efficiency. In 2017, Katz et al. also reported that ClB-\nDPPV doped with tetrabutylammonium fluoride (TBAF) was\nstable under ambient conditions. Doping with 25 mol% TBAF\nenabled them to achieve the maximum σ of 0.62 S cm-1 and PF\nof 0.63 μW m-1 K-2 in air. The good stability was maintained even\nafter the doped compound was exposed to air for a week (main-\ntaining σ = 0.1 S cm-1).60 \nIn addition, two different DPP-based D-A polymers, poly[2,5-\nbis(2-octyldodecyl)-3,6-di(pyridin-2-yl)-pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-\n1,4(2H,5H)-dionealt-(E)-2,2'-(ethene-1,2-diylbis(thiophene-5,2-\ndiyl))] (PDPH) and poly[2,5-bis(2-octyldodecyl)-3,6-di(pyridin-\n2-yl)-pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4(2H,5H)-dionealt-(E)-2,2'-(ethene-\n1,2-diylbis(3,4-difluorothiophene-5,2-diyl))] (PDPF) with fluo-\nrine substituents were synthesized.61 Although their neat films\nexhibited similar μe values (1.34 and 1.19 cm2 V-1 s-1 for PDPH and\nPDPF, respectively), the σ and PF values significantly differed\nafter doping with N-DMBI. After doping, PDPF had optimal σ\nand PF values of 1.30 S cm-1 and 4.65 μW m-1 K-2 and those of\nPDPH were 1.01 × 10-4 S cm-1 and 5.11 × 10-4 μW m-1 K-2, respec-\ntively. Morphological study using GIWAXS showed that both\nPDPH and PDPF had strong edge-on orientation. As the dopant\nconcentration increased, the film morphology of PDPH was dis-\nturbed and N-DMBI aggregates appeared. On the other hand,\nPDPF exhibited uniform morphology with a higher doping effi-\nciency, suggesting that simple modification by introducing F\nsubstitution had the effect of locking the conformation, which\nlowered both the HOMO and LUMO, resulting in enhanced dop-\ning efficiency and TE properties. In 2019, a new n-dopant (N-\nDMBI)2, which is a dimeric structure of N-DMBI, was designed\nand synthesized by considering the high reduction ability (sim-\nilar to that of the dimeric metal dopant (RuCp*mes)2) and size\nof the resulting dopant counterion after doping occurs.62 Pei and\ncoworkers studied the effects of the dopant on the TE properties\nof FBDPPV by utilizing three different dopants of (N-DMBI)2, N-\nDMBI, and (RuCp*mes)2. The maximum σ of FBDPPV with N-DMBI\nand (N-DMBI)2 was ~8 S cm-1, but σ with (RuCp*mes)2 was 1.6\nS cm-1. Even though N-DMBI and (N-DMBI)2 dopants yielded sim-\nilar σ, 43 mol% of N-DMBI was used whereas only 10.7 mol%\nof (N-DMBI)2 was used to reach the maximum σ, indicating the\nhigher doping efficiency of (N-DMBI)2. The PF values were deter-\nmined to be approximately 7, 5, and 1 μW m-1 K-2 with (N-DMBI)2,\nN-DMBI, and (RuCp*mes)2 as dopants, respectively. Morpho-\nlogical analyses by AFM, GIWAXS, and scanning kelvin probe\nmicroscopy (SKPM) indicated that (N-DMBI)2 demonstrated less\nperturbation of the original ordered microstructures because\nof its smaller and more planar counterion N-DMBI+ relative to the\nbulky RuCp*mes+. The researchers claimed that not only the dop-\ning mechanism but also the shape (or size) of dopant counterions\nstrongly influenced the TE and charge transport properties. To\nfurther investigate the effect of backbone rigidity, Pei et al. syn-\nthesized poly{(2,6-dioxo-6,7-dihydrobenzo[1,2-b:4,5-b']difuran-\n3(2H)-ylidene)-1,5-bis(2-octyldodecyl)-5,7-dihydropyrrolo[2,3-\nf]indole-2,6(1H,3H)-dione} (LPPV-1) and poly{(2,6-dioxo-6,7-\ndihydrobenzo[1,2-b:4,5-b']difuran-3(2H)-ylidene)-1,5-bis(2-\ndecyltetradecyl)-5,7-dihydropyrrolo[2,3-f] indole-2,6(1H,3H)-\ndione} (LPPV-2) with various alkyl side-chains.63 These two poly-\nmers differ in that LPPV-1 contains shorter octyldodecyl side-\nchains, whereas LPPV-2 has longer decyltetradecyl side-chains.\nBoth of these polymers also have a locked conformation with\nstructures that are nearly torsion-free. Further, the small changes\nin the crystallinity of both polymers (LPPV-1 and LPPV-2) upon\ndoping with N-DMBI indicated that the dopants were well mixed\nin the amorphous regions. LPPV-1 showed the higher σ (1.1 S\ncm-1) and PF (1.96 μW m-1 K-2) than LPPV-2 (σ = 0.07 S cm-1 and\nPF = 0.25 μW m-1 K-2) with high stability when exposed to air\n(PF only decreased by 2% after exposure to air for 7 days). The\nstrong planarity of the conjugated backbone combined with\nstrong side-chain interaction as a result of the shorter alkyl side-\nchain was suggested to reduce the conformational disorder of\nLPPV-1 and to elongate its polaron delocalization. \n3. Molecular Doping\nMolecular doping is a powerful technique to tune the σ of\norganic materials as the doping process introduces additional\ncharge carriers (i.e., polarons and bipolarons) into the molecu-\nlar backbone via charge transfer (chemical oxidation or reduc-\ntion).13,20,64-66 Several p- and n-type dopants have been developed\nand their molecular structures are collected in Figure 3. In par-\nticular, p-doping requires the HOMO level of a polymer (known\nas an electron-rich p-type polymer) to be close to or higher than\nthe LUMO level of the dopant to enable positive polarons (and/or\nbipolarons) to be introduced into the polymer chain via efficient\nelectron transfer from the polymer to the dopant.46 Coprocess-\ning of the polymer and dopant is the most common way of doping.\nAs an example of p-doping, Muller et al. explored the coprocess-\ning of p(g42T-T) and the dopant F4TCNQ in a 1:1 mixture of ace-\ntonitrile and chloroform to dope the polymer.44 Upon doping,\nthe increased carrier density not only increased the σ but also\nbleached the absorption of the neutral polymer at 600 nm as\nshown in the UV-vis spectra of p(g42T-T) film (Figure 4).

In the case of n-doping, the\ndopants transfer electrons to the LUMO of electron-deficient n-\ntype polymers, generating negative polarons (and/or bipolar-\nons) along the polymer backbone. As an example, the most widely\nused n-type dopant, N-DMBI, can dope polymers via hydrogen\natom transfer followed by the creation of an electron transfer\npathway (Figure 4). After casting the films of a mixture of the\npolymer and dopant, the films are heated to form N-DMBI neu-\ntral radicals. This neutral radical has an exceptionally high singly\noccupied molecular orbital (SOMO) level, allowing an electron\nto be instantly transferred to the LUMO of the polymer, leading\nto the formation of a stable N-DMBI cation.67 Therefore, the poly-\nmer is reduced by electron transfer to generate negative polar-\nons and bipolarons in the polymer backbone.\nThe method according to which a dopant is introduced into a\npolymer plays a critical role in determining the doping efficacy\nby charge transfer. “Solution-mixed doping” in which the doped\npolymer film is fabricated by casting a solution containing a\nmixture of the polymer and the dopant in the desired ratio, is\nthe most commonly used method owing to its simplicity.31,68-70\nHowever, the use of this method for doping often results in the\nformation of aggregates when the dopant concentration is increased.\nCharge transfer between the polymer and dopant forms a charge\ntransfer (CT) complex and the fact that the solubility of the charged\nspecies differs from that of the neutral polymers (and dopants),\ncauses them to readily precipitate from the organic solvents used\nfor processing to ultimately yield poor-quality films.70,71 In addi-\ntion, aggregation also occurs owing to the presence of excess\ndopants, which in turn affects the morphology of films with sig-\nnificant phase separation.72 Therefore, casted films fabricated\nby solution-mixed doping with high dopant concentrations often\nlead to blended film morphologies that exhibit low carrier\nmobilities.73 To circumvent these problems, the one-step solu-\ntion-mixing process could be replaced by a two-step process of\n“sequential doping.” First, the pristine polymer solution is pre-\ncasted, after which it is exposed to dopants in a secondary step.\nExposure of the pre-casted films to dopants is often accomplished\nby immersion, solution casting (drop casting or spin coating),\nand vapor doping.

That is, dopants should be dissolved in a semi-\northogonal solvent in which the pre-cast polymer films should\nnot dissolve; rather, the films should expand to enable the dop-\nants to penetrate the film without disturbing the ordered poly-\nmer packing.74 The doping level can be adjusted by changing\nthe dopant concentration and the expandability of the film by\nusing different solvents in the second step in which the dopant\nsolution is cast.75 Although this fabrication method is not as\nsimple as the conventional solution-mixed doping process, it\noffers several advantages such as the preserved morphology of\npre-cast films, smooth film morphology, and higher charge mobil-\nity and σ with fewer trapped charge carriers.74,76\nMany research groups implemented sequential doping meth-\nods in several different ways. The commonly used method that\nhas emerged is the “vapor doping method” or “solid state diffu-\nsion”, which is a sequential-doping method because the dopant\nis introduced onto pre-cast polymer films; hence, the method\ncould be also referred to as “vapor sequential doping”. Dopant\nvapor is deposited onto the pre-casted film by heating the dop-\nants (sublimation or evaporation) to allow the dopant molecules\nto penetrate the polymer chains. Many recent reports describe\nthe doping of P3HT and PBTTT by F4TCNQ with the aim of com-\nparing the solution-mixed doping and vapor doping methods.\nThese studies proved that the higher σ resulting from the vapor\ndoping method is attributable to the crystalline ordering of the\nfilms after doping, because the morphology of the films was not\ndisrupted, whereas the solution-mixed doping method produced\nconsiderably rougher films even at much lower doping levels\n(less than 1 mol% in the P3HT:F4TCNQ system dissolved in\nchlorobenzene).30,31,76-78 One of the main demerits of sequential\ndoping methods is that they can only be used for thin films\n(<100 nm) because dopant penetration into a solid film is lim-\nited.79 However, recently Fontana et al. demonstrated success-\nfully that even ~2-µm-thick films can be efficiently doped by\nsolution sequential doping by using an appropriate choice of\nsolvent and dopant concentration.74 These thick films were\nprepared by drop casting P3HT solution dissolved in o-dichlo-\nrobenzene onto glass substrates, which were then slowly dried\nby placing them inside a covered Petri dish for 2 days. Once the\npolymer layer had dried, the dopant solution (F4TCNQ in dichloro-\nmethane) was spin casted to form a layer on top of the polymer.\nThe thickest film (2 µm) showed the highest σ of approximately\n5S cm-1 owing to the higher ordering of polymers, which increases\nthe carrier mobility.\nIn addition, as the doped carrier concentration increases, σ\nincreases, but α decreases, showing an inverse relationship. Zhu\net al. reported the solution-mixed doping of n-type polymers,\nA-DCV-DPPTT and Q-DCM-DPPTT with N-DMBI. The undoped\nA-DCV-DPPTT and Q-DCM-DPPTT films showed high α values\nof -1215 and -875 μV K-1, respectively. However, the σ for both\npristine films were lower than 0.001 S cm-1. Upon doping with\nN-DMBI, the α of A-DCV-DPPTT decreased to -830 μV K-1 at 1 wt%\nN-DMBI and -568 μV K-1 at 5 wt% N-DMBI, while the σ increased\nto 0.3 and 3.1 S cm-1, respectively. The doped Q-DCM-DPPTT\nalso showed a similar inverse trend: as α decreased from -875\nto -383 μV K-1, the σ increased up to ~0.1 S cm-1 at 5 wt% N-DMBI.15\nWoo et al. reported a p-type polymer PCPDTSBT showing the\nFigure 4.

Charge Transport Models\nDespite extensive studies on organic TE materials and devices\nthat led to remarkable improvements in the TE performance,\ntheir charge transport behavior is not yet clearly understood. A\nstandard and robust model to describe the charge carrier\ntransport behavior in disordered organic materials has yet to\nbe proposed because of the many localized charge carriers and\ncomplex microstructures, which make it difficult to define the\ncarrier density (n) and mobility (μ) in organic TE devices.80\nRecently, several efforts have been made to understand the charge\ntransport behavior in organic TE devices by studying the rela-\ntion between α and σ.\n4.1. Mott mobility edge model and variable range hopping\nmodel\nIn the Mott mobility edge (ME) model, ME is the highest energy\nlevel that separates localized and non-localized states in the\nconduction band (or valence band) of non-crystalline materials.81\nThis model assumes that the carriers below ME are trapped\nand thus do not contribute to the conduction, whereas the car-\nriers above the ME are delocalized and freely conduct electric-\nity similar to a metal. According to the ME model, the σ and α of\nthe amorphous semiconductors can be expressed by the fol-\nlowing equations:\n(2)\n(3)\nHere,σ0 is the pre-exponential factor, EC is the mobility edge, kB\nis Boltzmann’s constant, e is the unit charge, T is the tempera-\nture, A is dimensionless and greater than 1 and is related to the\nweighted conductivity DOS, EF is the Fermi energy, and EV is the\nvalence energy.82-84 Chabinyc et al. used an estimation of the\nactivation energy EA as being correlated to EF-EV and the exper-\nimental trends of EA ∝lnσ to derive the relationship between α\nand σ by using the following equation:82\n(4)\nwhere B and C are constants and are given by fitting the activa-\ntion energy to the conductivity. The solid line in Figure 5 shows\nthe α-σ fitting curve based on this equation. However, the model\ndoes not fit the experimental data well. This could be explained\nby considering that the assumptions of the model may not be\nappropriate for the nature of the organic (or polymeric) semi-\nconductors. First, Mott established this model for disordered\nsemiconductors with homogeneity; however, contrary to the\nassumption of the model, the σ of polymeric semiconductors is\nthermally activated even for carriers with energy above the trans-\nport edge. \nAnother well-known charge transport model for explaining\namorphous inorganic semiconductors and organic materials is\nthe hopping transport model.85,86 Owing to their energetic and\nstructural disorder, these materials form localized states among\nwhich charge transport occurs via thermally assisted hopping.\nTwo types of hopping conduction models have been reported:\nnearest neighbor hopping (NNH) and variable range hopping\n(VRH). The probability of hopping between two states that are\nseparated in terms of both their spatial locations and their energies\nis generally given by the Millar-Abrahams transition rate.87 When\ncharge carriers have sufficient energy, spatial separation becomes\nthe dominant factor; thus, they hop to the nearest empty neigh-\nboring site (NNH model). However, at low thermal energies, charge\ncarriers become energetically favorable to tunnel to non-nearest\nsites with lower energies irrespective of their spatial separation\nand this is referred to as VRH. The VRH model assumes that charge\ntransport occurs only around the EF and at a constant DOS. The\nσ and α can be described as follows:84\n(5)\n(6)\nwhere σ0 is the pre-exponential factor, T is temperature, the\nvariable T0 is found via the temperature dependent σ of the\nMott relation, and N is the DOS. In 2015, Chabinyc et al. also tried\nto fit a curve to the α-σ relationship based on the VRH model\n(dash-single dotted line in Figure 5). However, it also did not fit\nthe experimental data of organic semiconductors because the\nestimated value of α was too small (of the order of 10 μV K-1),\nwhereas the α of semiconducting polymers normally has an\nexceedingly higher value in all conductivity ranges.\n4.2. Power law relation\nAs shown above, it is difficult to explain the relationship between\nα and σ of semiconducting (or conducting) polymers with pre-\nestablished models. In 2015, Chabinyc et al. discovered a trend\nthat shows a surprisingly good fit over a wide range of conduc-\ntivities in which the thermopower curve is fit to the empirical\npower law following the equation below:\n(7)\nwhere σα is an unknown conductivity constant that is indepen-\ndent of the carrier concentration. Consequently, the PF is related\nto the inverse square-root of the conductivity, PF ∝σ -1/2 (dotted\nline in Figure 5(a) and Figure 5(b)).82 Here, they measured and\nplotted the thermoelectric properties of the well-known poly-\nσ\nσ0exp\nEC EF\n–\nkBT\n--------------\n–\n⎩\n⎭\n⎨\n⎬\n⎧\n⎫\n=\nα\nkB\ne---- EF EV\n–\nkBT\n--------------\nA\n+\n⎝\n⎠\n⎛\n⎞\n=\nα\nkB\ne---- Blnσ\nC\n+\nkBT\n--------------------\n⎝\n⎠\n⎛\n⎞\nA\n+\n=\nσ\nσ0exp\nT0\nT----\n⎝\n⎠\n⎛\n⎞\n1\n1\nd\n+\n----------\n–\n⎩\n⎭\n⎨\n⎬\n⎧\n⎫\n=\nα\nkB\n2\ne---- T0T\n(\n)\n1\n2--dlnN\ndE\n-----------\nEF\n=\nα\nkB\ne---- σ\nσα\n-----\n⎝\n⎠\n⎛\n⎞\n1/4\n–\n=",

In 2017, Kang and Snyder suggested a new empirical model\n(the K-S model) which suggested a more profound understand-\ning of the charge transport properties of organic TE systems.80\nThey defined the transport function σE(E) using two essential\nparameters, the transport edge Et and transport parameter σ:\n \n(8)\nHere, σE0(T) is the transport coefficient, which is a tempera-\nture-dependent but energy independent parameter, kB is Boltz-\nmann’s constant, and T is the temperature. The definitions of σ\nand α were obtained in terms of σ and η by applying this equa-\ntion to the generalized Boltzmann transport equations:\n(9)\n(10)\nwhere Fi is the Fermi-Dirac integral, η=(EF-Et)/kBT is the reduced\nchemical potential, and q is the unit charge. The transport coef-\nficient σE0(T) acts as a weighted mobility, which determines the\nmagnitude of σ. The transport parameter s indicates the energy\ndependency of the charge transport. By fitting the α-σ relation\nof organic TE systems by the K−S model, it is possible to obtain\ninformation on their charge transport properties. In Mott’s mobil-\nity edge model, charge carriers are transported similarly to free\nelectrons above the transport edge, i.e., transport is energy inde-\npendent with s = 0. The α-σ relations of various semiconducting\npolymers (such as P3HT, PBTTT-C14, and P2TDC17-FT4) pro-\nvided a surprisingly good fit with s = 3 (Figure 5), indicating that\ncharge transport above Et has a strong energy dependence due\nto the ionized-impurity scattering. To date, only a few PEDOT-\nbased systems (PEDOT:Tos26 and PEDOS-C6\n95) have been reported\nto follow the α-σ curve with s = 1 (σE0=75 and 10 S cm-1, respec-\ntively) among the organic TE materials reported thus far, demon-\nstrating atypical charge transport properties (depending on\nacoustic-phonon scatterings) with high thermoelectric proper-\nties compared to other semiconducting polymers. Therefore, a\nstrong demand has arisen to develop new organic TE systems\nwith s = 1 with a high σE0 value to achieve high TE properties for\nwhich ZT exceeds 1. \nSeveral recent studies analyzed the charge transport proper-\nties on the basis of the K−S model. Gleason et al. compared the\ncarrier mobilities of PEDOT thin films fabricated by oxidative\nchemical vapor deposition.96 They compared the transport coef-\nficient, σE0, of PEDOT films with different orientations and dif-\nferent deposition temperatures. They also calculated and compared\nthe Wγ of PEDOT films, which is the energy barrier for inter-\ncrystallite percolation carrier transport, by using the equation\nσE0∝exp\n, where γ is the dimensionality factor. Their\nanalyses with the values of σE0 and Wγ indicated that the films\nwith face-on orientation and deposited at high temperature\nhad superior transport properties compared to the films with\nedge-on orientation. In addition, in the original report of Kang\nand Snyder, the factors responsible for determining the trans-\nport parameter, σ, were unclear. Recently, Venkataraman et al.\nshowed that the spatial distribution of dopants in the doped\npolymer films can profoundly affect the α-σ relation because it\nsignificantly influences the degree of energetic disorder and\nchanges the DOS.97 They suggested that homogeneous doping\nreduced the energetic disorder (with s = 1) and improved charge\ntransport and thermoelectric performance.\n5. Flexible thermoelectric devices based on organic\nthermoelectric materials\nTE devices based on organic materials have been of vital inter-\nest for wearable applications because they are lightweight, have\nlow thermal conductivity, portability, and breathability, and are\neasily attached to clothes and curved surfaces. Flexible TE devices\nhave been fabricated with integration into flexible substrates\nincluding fabrics,98,99 organic elastomers such as polydimethyl-\nsiloxane (PDMS),100,101 polyethylene terephthalate (PET),9,102-104\npolyurethane (PU),105 and polyimide106-108 by using diverse meth-\nods such as printing,102 vacuum filtration,109 e-spraying,105 solvent\nevaporation101 and wet spinning.110 The integration of wearable\nTE devices into textile-based clothing has been attempted; how-\never, their TE performance needs to be balanced with the aes-\nthetics and comfort of the clothing. Additionally, the maximum\noutput power of polymer based-organic TE generators had reported\nto be too low (< 1 μW) for practical application.111 Many research\ngroups aiming to solve the low energy harvesting efficiency have\nattempted to enhance the properties of organic TE generators\nby chemical processing107 or by hybridization with highly conductive\nmaterials such as inorganic9,104 and carbon-based materials.110,112\nIn addition, research to lower the internal resistance of TE\nmodules100,103 and to improve the structural efficiency to main-\ntain the temperature difference between the hot and cold sides\nwas conducted for enhanced generated power.99,100,103-105,113 In\nTable 3, significant recent achievements in TE devices are sum-\nmarized by focusing on conducting polymers, carbon-based\nmaterials, and their composites.\nAs introduced in the previous section, PEDOT is the most\npopular conducting polymer owing to its high electrical conduc-\ntivity based on π-conjugated backbone and the delocalized π-\nelectrons.114 Therefore PEDOT-based conducting polymers have\nbeen reported as promising TE materials for application to\nwearable and flexible TE generators. Especially, PEDOT:PSS have\nbeen widely used because of facile processability and stability\nbecause the low solubility of PEDOT in aqueous solutions can\nbe improved by emulsification with PSS.115 As shown in Figure\n6(a), Lin et al. reported a wearable TE generator with air and\nmoisture permeability.98 In this report, the σ, α, and PF of\nPEDOT:PSS-coated polyester fabric were 1.5 S cm-1, 18.5 μV K-1,\nand 45 μW m-1 K-2 at 390 K, respectively. The TE performance\ncould be enhanced by increasing the σ without significant decrease\nof from 300 to 390 K. The device was based on PEDOT:PSS coated\nwith commercial polyester fabric with silver (Ag) wires as a\nconductive connection. The TE output voltage and maximum\noutput electrical power were 4.3 mV and 12.29 nW at a ΔT =\n75.2 K using five strips of polyester fabrics as the substrate,\nσE E T\n,\n(\n)\nσE0 T\n( )\nE Et\n–\nkBT\n------------\n⎝\n⎠\n⎛\n⎞\ns\n×\nE\nEt\n>\n(\n)\n=\n0 E\nEt\n<\n(\n)\n=\nσ\nσE0 T\n( ) sFs 1\n– η\n( )\n×\n=\nα\nkB\nq----\ns\n1\n+\n(\n)Fs η\n( )\nsFs 1\n– η\n( )\n--------------------------- η\n–\n=\nWγ\nkBT\n--------\n⎝\n⎠\n⎛\n⎞\nγ\n–",

ITO-PEDOT:PSS\nshowed a negative α value (-14.27 μV K-1) and slightly lower sheet\nresistance (30.9 ± 1.8 Ω sq-1 on PET, 9.7 ± 0.2 Ω sq-1 on glass) than\nthat of ITO film (31.4 ± 1.4 Ω sq-1 on PET, 10.6 ± 0.3 Ω sq-1 on glass).\nTE module was fabricated with eight p/n couples of dimensions\nof 50 mm × 5 mm. The resistance of the module was 13.8 ± 2.1 kΩ\nwith eight p/n couples and was linearly dependent on the number\nof p/n couples with a proportional relationship. The resistance\nwas mainly from low σ (750 S cm-1) of PEDOT:PSS as a p-type\nleg compared with ITO (7280 S cm-1).

The CNF@PP was prepared by using a\nsimple soaking method with DMSO. A high σ of 18.8 and 871 S cm-1\nwas achieved in CNF@PP and n-CNTs, respectively.

The n-type material prepared from PEI-SWCNTs\ngenerated a PF of 50 μW m-1 K-2 at 380 K. As shown in Figure\n10(a), the flexible TE modules were fabricated by stacking the\nprepared p- and n-type films alternatingly between insulating\nlayers. In terms of the TE performance, the TE voltage with four\np/n couples reached 7 mV at a temperature gradient of 50 K.\nBecause of their low electrical resistance formed by well-perco-\nlated networks of SWCNTs, the maximum power of 960 nW\nwas generated. Pan et al. used the block copolymer poly(ether-b-\namide12) (PEBA) with excellent flexibility and mechanical\nproperties to fabricate TE materials by blending with CNTs\n(Figure 10(b)).108 After doping the PEBA with lithium chloride\n(PEBA-Li+), two types (p- and n-type) of CNT-filled PEBA-Li+\n(CNT-PEBA-Li+) TE composites were obtained via a simple one-\nstep casting method. The n-type CNT was obtained by using\ndiethylenetriamine (DETA) as a dopant. The TE module was\nfabricated by stacking bilayer heterogeneous structures of\nthermally nonconductive and conductive layers. The results\nshowed that the TE voltage of the module consisting of three p/\nn couples was able to reach 120 mV at a temperature gradient\nof 60 K. In addition, Cho et al. reported that a TE generator was\nfabricated from CNT foam with a porous structure.101 The ultralow\nthermal conductivity of 0.17 W m-1 K-1 together with the extremely\nhigh porosity (above 90%) was considered to be the main rea-\nson for the enhanced TE performance. The highly porous struc-\nture of CNT foam contributed to the enhancement of phonon\nscattering, which yielded thermal conductivity 100 times lower\nthan that of a CNT film with a densely packed network. As shown\nin Figure 10(c), a TE device fabricated with optimized p- and n-\ndoped CNT foams exhibited optimal output power (1.5 µW) and\noutput power per weight (82 µW g-1), respectively, at a tempera-\nture gradient of 13.9 K.\nAnother important parameter to increase the TE performance\nis to optimize the electrical connection between TE materials,\nbecause contact resistance between the TE materials and the\nelectrode can impede the performance. Therefore, electrode-\nfree TE devices have drawn much attention. Kim and Park et al.\nreported an ultralight flexible device based on carbon nano-\ntube yarn (CNTY), as shown in Figure 11(a), which solved the\nproblem of high contact resistance.100 The prepared CNTY was\ndivided into three parts, the n-type part doped with PEI, p-type\npart doped with FeCl3, and the undoped CNTY was used as the\nelectrode instead of the traditional metal electrode to mini-\nmize the circuit resistance. This structure exhibited superior σ\nof 3147 S cm-1 owing to increased longitudinal carrier mobility\nderived from the highly aligned structure. The circuit resistance of\nFigure 11.

Zhou and Xie et al. also reported a technique to fabricate\ncompact flexible TE modules with a novel configuration (Figure\n11(b)).103 The large-area continuous CNT film was synthesized\nvia the floating catalyst chemical vapor deposition method. A\nCNT strip (96 × 10 mm2) from the synthesized film was placed\non PET substrate. PEI solution was dropped onto the prepared\nCNT strip for localized n-type doping in the unshaded area of\nthe strip with an alternately designed mask. The optimized\nn-type film exhibited an ultrahigh PF of ~1,500 μW m-1 K-2 and\noutstanding stability in air without additional encapsulation.\nThe open-circuit voltage, maximum output power, and power\ndensity of this CNT module with three couples were 11.3 mV,\n2.51 µW, and 167 mW cm-2 with small internal resistance of\n12.5 Ω, respectively. It is worth mentioning that this technique\ncould possibly be used in large-scale synthesis and mass pro-\nduction in combination with a technique capable of direct and\nhigh-yield synthesis of continuous CNT films.\n6. Conclusions\nRecently, organic TE generators have achieved remarkable\nadvancements by extensive studies on p- and n-type materials\ndesign, new dopants and doping methods, morphology control in\ndoped films and optimization of device architectures. By tailoring\npost-treatments, PEDOT:PSS showed the highest ZT value of\n0.75, demonstrating a similar TE performance to inorganic\ncounterparts at room temperature. n-Type organic TE materi-\nals have also achieved the highest ZT up to ~0.2, which is still\npoorer compared to p-type ones due to their poor air stability\nand σ. It is important to explore further the new candidates of\np- and n-type TE materials for improving TE performances. Sys-\ntematic approaches are continuously required including struc-\ntural engineering of conjugated backbones and substituted side-\nchains, and tailoring doping methodology. Developing new dop-\nants are also necessary which can fine-modulate the carrier\nconcentration in the doped organic materials without disturb-\ning original crystalline film morphology. The σ and α have a\ntrade-off relationship depending on the carrier concentration:\nas the carrier density increases, σ increases, but α decreases.\nThus, it is important to precisely control the amount of doping\nconcentration to achieve the maximum PF. Decoupling the\ntrade-off relationship of σ and α needs to be also investigated\nfor further improving the PF. In addition, the charge transport\nproperties in the doped TE polymers (and small molecules) are\nnot well understood at a present stage. It is challenging to pre-\ncisely measure the carriers concentration and their mobility in\ndoped materials, which makes it difficult to optimize the TE\nperformance. Currently, the several charge transport models\nwhich were originally developed for inorganic systems, are\napplied to organic TE systems with some modifications, show-\ning a limited interpretation for the charge transport behaviors\nin organic materials. A new theoretical model specialized for\norganic TE systems are necessary to be developed.\nFlexible organic TE devices, which have been gaining the\ngrowing scientific interests, are a promising candidate as renew-\nable energy sources, especially in the application of energy har-\nvesting for flexible and wearable devices based on human body\ntemperature. The combination of organic TE materials with\ntextile-based clothing as well as a flexible heat sink for smart\nfashion becomes a new tendency of the wearable device. How-\never, the TE power generation performances of organic TE gener-\nators are much lower compared to conventional inorganic devices\nbased on Bi2Te3, PbTe, SbTe, and so on, which is attributed to\nthe smaller ZT values of organic TE materials and the high con-\ntact resistance between the organic semiconductor layer and\nmetal electrodes, as well as limited device configurations for\nthe high-temperature gradient TE energy conversion. To further\nenhance the TE performances of organic TE generators, a care-\nful attention should be also directed to the device integration\nwhich decreases the contact resistance by interface engineer-\ning between TE layers and electrodes as well as developments\nof new novel flexible electrode materials. A new architecture\ndesign for conformal thermal contact on the hot surface of heat\nsource is also required for efficient thermal transport and large\ntemperature gradient generation in organic TE devices. By con-\nsidering the potentials and advantages of organic TE genera-\ntors compared to inorganic counterparts, intensive studies should\nbe directed toward opening plausible real applications of organic\nTE devices. \nReferences\n (1) C.
